# InfoPresentation

## Presentation

A React web app, which works as a presentation (like PowerPoint but much cooler).
It's written in TypeScript and created with `create-react-app`.

## Benchmarks

Tiny C++ command line tool, for creating benchmarks of Radix and Quicksort.
It produces .json files containing the data, which can be used `presentation/src/views/Benchmark.tsx`.
Copy-paste the content of the generated files into `presentation/src/model/data/*.json`.

## Documentation

The LaTeX documentation of the project. It is not a developer documentation but a required layout of
the presentation itself, not the code.
